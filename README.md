#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering takes into consideration, the various activities that are involved in the beginning and ending of software. It involves the planning, designing, developing, deployment and maintaining of software. The term is very important in the technology industry because it ensures that quality tools and projects are delivered for usage. It helps to take into consideration, the users, customers, and other stakeholders to be part of the software or project being developed for them. It also ensure that, the general standard are met when creating software for usage.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C, C++) that allowed programmers to write programs for the computer. 
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s. When development increased, there was a need to build standard upon which most developed tools will follow. example of such standards includes using 1 for high (On) and ) for low (off) on electronic devices. some of the organization in charge of setting some of these standards includes the IEEE. 
- The advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs, functional and system requirements.
  - Plan and Design: Planning and creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a sequencial approach. Project activities are done in an orderly manner. When step one is not completed, you can't move to step two. The second phase is dependent on the first phase. Unlike Agile methodology that breaks large activities into smaller tasks to be worked on. Agile method is flexible does not follow a sequential pattern. It promote collaboration and responds well to changes unlike waterfall where a change is very difficult and almost impossible since a change can cause the project to fail or restart. 

- Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is performs all the activities on the software development life cycle. The software developer is incharge of gathering data, planning and designing of solution, implementing the solution obtained, testing out the solution, deploying the solution for usages and ensuring all challenges that will arise concerning the solution are handled. 
- Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that software, or projects are delivered based on the standards provided. It is the job of the quality assurance engineer to ensure nothing but top notch product is delivered to the customer.
- Project Manager is the one that sees to the whole process of the project. They take into consideration the scope, the cost, the timeline and also manage the other engineers or departments on the project to ensure that the project is delivered on time and also meet customer requirements. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDE helps developers to find more flexibility and control over their source codes. IDE provides more colourful and organized way for developers to write code with less errors. Some IDEs also comes with debuggers that helps developers to identify and resolve bugs/errors in their code. example is visual studio code, anaconda navigator and pycharm
- Version Control System on the other hand helps developer to make numerous changes to one source code and save it as new project. Version control is useful for developers since previous saved veersions can be used to rollback if new updates causes the program to fail or crush. Example of version control tool is the Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Scope Change: Due to changes in customers preferences, sometimes, it becomes difficult to maintain the scope of which softwares, or projects are built on. It is very important that developers get a clear requirement from customers before they start with their activities. Also, developers should reduce customers interferances in the development cycle.
- Tight Deadlines: Sometimes it becomes difficult to meet customer deadlines due to scope change and customer engagements. The best approach to this is to stick to some of the methodology that is flexible and encourage collaboration (agile methodology). This method helps to breakdown chunk of activities into smaller tasks to be handled be separate teams.  

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing: This is the testing the individual units in a program source code. The individual units maybe functions, variables, expressions. These tests are done to ensure that each line executes in a way as intented to. Unit testing are mostly done during the debugging face.
- Integration testing: this is done to ensure that new program works seemlessly with the other part of the codes.
- System testing: This is the testing of the program to ensure that is performs the way it should. The system is carrying out the purpose it was being created for.
- Acceptance testing: This is where the functional and system requirements are all passed and the software is performing in a way it should. At this stage, the system is compared the general standards. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of writing, refining and optimizing inputs to encourage generative AI systems to create specific, high-quality outputs. It is the process that involves given the AI model more specific data on which the search is to be carried out. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: Suggest a cool song from the 90s.
Improved: Suggest a song that is composed before 2000, which is more classical in nature yet slow in tune with calm lyrics.
